MSc in Financial Engineering capstone project repository for Portfolio Optimization

The rise of cryptocurrencies alongside traditional stocks presents new challenges 
for portfolio optimization. While traditional portfolio optimization methods such as 
Mean-Variance and Black-Litterman are robust, we need portfolio optimization to be 
more adaptive and intelligent in the current world to optimize strategies for 
investment. This study explores portfolio optimization using ML and DL models to 
determine whether these types of advanced models can outperform traditional models. 
We aim to integrated at least ten predictive models' power, including MLP, LSTM, 
CNN, XGBoost, Transformer, Decision Tree, SVR, Linear Regression, Ridge 
Regression, and ensemble learning. We will evaluate these models by using daily 
returns data from two cryptocurrencies and 9 stocks from 2018 to 2024.
